# go-snake

started using go today. just tried to recreate a basic project i made a long time ago in c++. it should be noted this isn't a sincere recreation of snake for several reasons:

1. the snake can overlap itself
2. the snake plays itself (no ai, always takes the longest path)

this was mainly just to familiarize myself with the language
